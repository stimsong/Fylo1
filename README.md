Project: Beta sign up split layout

This is a single page sign up site developed using HTML and CSS. It is a responsive design with mobile and desktop layouts. 

It is a beginner project that was developed from some basic information from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontend Mentor</a> such as a jpg file of what the site should look like and some style info such as the colors and fonts to be used. No functionality was specified but as I continue to learn, it's fun to come back to apply any new techniques if I feel that it would improve the site.

Here are the jpg design files that was used to develop the site...
